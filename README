** About Genoverse **

- Genoverse is available from https://github.com/wtsi-web/Genoverse and actually
  has very few requirements. A brief _Help_ document is available at
  http://wtsi-web.github.io/Genoverse/help.pdf.

- The scripts included in this repository simply convert the Human Gene Module and
  CNV module data into JSON files, delete some of the information from those files,
  and separate them into chromosome-specific files that Genoverse will load
  when it is called. Editing the file locations at the top of
  gv/scripts/workflow.sh should be sufficient.

- Ideally, Genoverse would obtain data from an API. However, we have never spent
  the time to implement this and have instead chosen the easier route of using
  static files, which it still seems to load reasonably quickly.
